What is a motherboard?
----------------------
Ties the whole computer together.
A motherboard contains the support components(Audio cards[also known as "audio codec"], Ethernet/Wifi etc., additional usb buses), as well as slots for extensions that connect directly into cpu/chipset.

Motherboards tie all the components together, as well as deal with power delivery to most components(sata devices excluded).

PCIe and USB connectors are negotiating their respective protocol versions, this way devices are compatibile(almost) no matter what.

Cpu sockets are usually not compatibile with each other(with AM2/AM2+/AM3/AM3+ being the exception).
Ram sticks aren't cross compatibile with each other.

What is an IO Chip?
-------------------
It's primarly a fan controller to which additional temperature sensors are connected.

What are power phase?
----------------------
Power phases are (more than just) voltage regulators, the load(Amperage) is distributed alongside said power phases.

What is m.2?
------------
It's a standard for a connector, it contains multiple bus types(I2S, SPI, most notably: PCIe, usb).
While mostly used for SSDs and laptop wifi cards, it's a general purpose connector and doesn't restrict the use of PCIe lanes for a specific purpose.

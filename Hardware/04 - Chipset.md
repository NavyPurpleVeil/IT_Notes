What is a chipset?
------------------
Chipset is an additional support chip usually placed in the motherboard, these days cpus contain their own internal chipsets.
Since quiet sometime chipsets limit the featureset of a cpu (overclocking, amd store me etc.).
Chipsets extend the I/O capabilities of the cpu, often add a couple extra pcie lanes.
A chipset also initializes the cpu(in case of amd there's a special dummy chipset which activates the cpu into cpuChipset-only mode).

iGPUs and media decoders once could be found in a chipset(or motherboard), these days they are found on cpus.

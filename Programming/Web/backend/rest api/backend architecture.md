Backend architecture
--------------------
Backend architecture can be differentiated into server-side and into code that executes.

Server-side we can differenciate:
* Regular vps(es)/on-premises hosting, with various degrees of load balancing techniques, as well as single server instances.
* Cloud-hosted, usually scalling via some form of kubernetes/k8s.

In case of code the main differenciatals are:
* Monolithic services, (?Board and DM implement their own file upload service?)
* Microservices, (In an "board"+DMs situation an image upload microservice would handle uploading images for private messages and the board, the difference is also in seperation of the codebases into smaller projects which can often can be reused in another website)

Backends can also differ in ways they render a website:
* Server-side approach: website entirely generated by the backend, content can be either static or dynamic. (Outdated form taught in schools, babies-first php website). Usually xhr-less approach.
* Hybrid approach: website skeleton/form skeletons generated by the backend, the website sends off xhr api requests to know which content to fetch.
* Client generate: website served as static file(with dynamic conent) by the web server. All content is grabbed from xhrs.

#### Shell?
Shell is a simplified interface, for program setup and can be used for automation with conjuction with other tools/inhibitors.


Each command argument is space separated:
```bash
ls folder with spaces
```
This command will try to list contents of folders/names of files(and where they link) called:
* ``folder``
* ``with``
* ``spaces``
We can either seperate the names by spaces or with a use of a single/double quotes, or an escape character:
* ``"folder with spaces"``
* ``folder\ with\ spaces``
* ``'folder with spaces'``
